# Contribution guidelines

## Before starting work

 1. Search this repo's [issues](https://www.github.com/foundersandcoders/open-tourism-platform/issues) to see if an issue exists for the problem you are solving.
 2. If the issue does not exist, create it.
 3. If your new issue relates to any others, reference those issues in the body. This enables others to follow the history of the topic.
 5. Indicate on the issue that you would like to take it on. Assign one of the reviewers above if you need a response.
 6. Once you are sure of what you need to do and that it is needed, assign yourself to the issue.
 7. Clone, and create a new branch for your work.

## Commits

Remember to keep your commits granular and their messages short but descriptive.

**It is important that you reference an issue in each commit.**

### Multiline messages

You will want to space your commit messages over more than one line. Commit without the `-m` to bring up a text editor in which to write the commit message.

You may want to configure git to use your preferred text editor, if you do not like the default. ie. [Set atom to be default commit message editor](https://help.github.com/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git/#using-atom-as-your-editor).

The message should have the format

replace square braces
```md
short description under 50 chars.
[newline]
more detailed description (may be bullet points)
[newline]
related #[issue number]
```
or
```md
short description under 50 chars.
[newline]
related #[issue number]
```

## Pull Requests

Once you have finished your work, push up your branch and make a pull request. Make sure it has the following

  1. A good title
  2. Description, with detail of everything in the pull.
  3. Reference to any/all related issues in description.
  4. Add an in-progress label to the pull as you are working on it.
  5. When your pull is ready, assign it to the maintainers, and set the in-review label.

A pull request should be as small as possible, this makes the review process fast and easy.
