# Open Tourism Platform

If you want to get involved, checkout the [contributing file](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What?
An open backend to help support and facilitate the creation of apps and websites aimed at developing tourism.

Primarily, and during initial phases, this will be an open database of places, products, services, events and reviews.

## Next steps

#### Requirement gathering
A good place to start would be to gather the requirements of the apps build for the Nazareth tourism accelerator, from there we can start to spec out a version 1.
